327147666570108928	@mc_elhill @mhchat @womblegeorge #mhchat i had sleep paralysis every night for four months when i took quetiapine in addition to lamotrigine
328962220069371905	"since swapping my quetiapine doses around, my hunger and cravings have gotten so bad!"
329560003147087873	@hopingforhope1 i found it worked better for me than quetiapine because it didn't make me as drowsy.
331338155691229184	guess what? still feeling weird. fuck you quetiapine. fuck you.
331479118598246403	@bipolarblogger i'm on citalapram and 600mg quetiapine - i'm not sleeping!
331842963699286016	Got offered a seat on the tube this morning. Quetiapine, like pregnancy, but hungrier. #bipolarlifestylechoice
332225282062823424	not hungry but eating anyway. thank you quetiapine you utter cunt.
341327231508967424	"@nullfuture me too. major fatness since i started on the fabulous, non-soporific, weight-gaining quetiapine. it has to go or i will die."
342210117292392448	"i seem to need to sleep right now. quetiapine takers, is this normal?"
342217867749621762	@crescentcolours that'll be the quetiapine making you drowsy. it's a common side effect xx
342232503395962880	@jelizap tried lithium &amp; depakote been reading up on lamotrigine it was suggested but had such nightmare with quetiapine was scared to try
342662725165543426	people taking #quetiapine - does this need to sleep 24/7 go eventually? cos this is not sustainable beyond the short term.
342725404320210944	think i'm going to test this quetiapine headache theory &amp; take some prn &amp; see if it goes away.
344911702590099456	@whatkatie_did I'm certainly weird but it's quetiapine instead of crack, I can't get that on prescription.
345318152424546304	#restlesslegs #quetiapine
345725882620579841	@butterflywgs ...my old ones! plus caffeine in the morning counteracts these quite nicely whereas quetiapine hangovers were unshiftable
346418587210244097	@redbuttongirl combining them with the quetiapine makes me hallucinate :/
346677268946501632	and quetiapine makes you gain weight i'm scared
347124997317345280	act now and get our deluxe cyde-fx set absolutely free! experience lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis like never before! #quetiapine
347260952837754880	@bipolarblogger i hate quetiapine. i was so relieved to come off it and stop feeling like a zombie.
349659449692139520	this quetiapine isn't working damnit!!!! does make me hungry at night though... *sigh*
350606045862830080	it's raining. i ran for the bus when i didn't need to. my gp letter isn't right. sweating like a pig thanks to quetiapine. brighton bound!
351400394146070529	@inkyworld why i came off it. gp told me its not dangerous but it is damn unpleasant. at least i know it's the quetiapine that's causing it
351410557112434688	damn you quetiapine side effect. was quite enjoying being able to sleep at night
351605957421309952	still a slightly fast pulse this morning. i know this is the quetiapine
351834238540185600	@loveusnotdrugus many congratualtions for being able to come off quetiapine - i have read that and clozapine are the worst for withdrawals
352544481175801856	@cheer_bear13 quetiapine knocked me sidewards for a week then I suddenly woke up activated. Then relapsed, upped dose, activated & so on
352905914640109568	@stillicides well no. but it's just that i dropped my quetiapine last night. i slept horribly! but i feel v unfoggy...
353102470534279169	@lilythepurr i've had too much quetiapine today - i'm zombified.
353158902520619010	i have been on lorazepam / diazepam / quetiapine for the past few nights and i've noticed i am slightly drooling a bit. lovely.
353477521070751744	"whilst most kids ask santa for xmas presents, i'm like, can we reduce my quetiapine intake, i need to get out of bed"
353492546833498112	pretty sure the quetiapine was affecting my sense of taste
353493347912003584	@jennniff i didn't take a zopiclone in the end.. but i'm third day of no quetiapine &amp; i'm eating incredibly differently!
353643138826510336	this week i officially stopped taking my quetiapine. i'm happy to be able to have a life again and not sleep 12 hours.
353979581033750530	@lynseypattie @ukschizophrenic @polarbear3127 @weswroten its quetiapine for me. i was wearing factor 30 today &amp; i still burnt :-(
354004406896828416	quetiapine side affects are increased appetite and cravings. it all makes sense. ??????
354178409426993153	oh man! i've been a total quetiapine zombie all morning! i've been taking them for years but every now  then they really mess me up!
354310048798867456	@gangamstyledad is that like quetiapine. when i had to take that crap i could not stay up longer than 11 hours
354334544473751552	Since quetiapine's messed with my prolactin levels, making my boobs humungous & my bras so expensive, I want a lingerie component to DLA.

345410371047260163	seroquel is causing more gaps in memory, I don't remember going to therapy and as usual no one has stepped up to claim thos memories >>
345505230403825664	@jessovenden No more SSRI’s for me. They kept giving me manic reactions, usually angry. The Seroquel has me feeling too tired. It’s brutal
345547397381890049	@adelerosenbloom Getting off Seroquel (Sero-KILL) can cause convulsions, fever, toxic reactions, psychotic reactions. and other shit

349931566463590404	I need to progress onto oxazepam.Apparently it's more sedating. Seroquel is sedating, but you can hardly open or close your mouth.

336971197185146882	@lynnbett Off Venlafaxine which was pure hell for me, I can't switch these meds anymore, tired of feeling like shit all day.
341324494620733440	@asdfghjklucy_ venlafaxine was always awful for that. like someone sprayed hairspray all over my tongue... eww isn't a strong enough word!
342248119687331841	coming off 150mg venlafaxine over 14 days was a better idea in discussion. my brain feels like its actually vibrating! #willpower
342341320465076225	anyone who will listen: never ever take effexor/venlafaxine. paraesthesia abound.
343051602833330176	day 3 without #venlafaxine. worst drug ever to withdraw from? any support much appreciated!
343362848266797057	"so anyway last night.. my new medication (venlafaxine/effexor) made me feel the most depressed ever, and i overreacted about everything"
347814900548132865	"@mycuriousmind not sure. i took it with venlafaxine mostly, and think it was that which made me very tired"
349507022057766912	@BipolarBlogger yeah,  generic Venlafaxine has about four different slow release formulations,  I got withdrawals from some.
351111188026896384	packing whilst experiencing venlafaxine withdrawal is pretty hellish. got to keep track of my med times.
351395434624856064	"@mycuriousmind not that i ever noticed. i was taking it with venlafaxine, and it definitely made me drowsy"
351411363366703104	@sarahcherry88 @mycuriousmind i didn't find it any more sedative than just venlafaxine alone. prob a little less so :)
352526763387133953	@anwen @ellwynnnnn venlafaxine withdrawal is worse than most by miles x
353061971907723266	"i just have to remember that what i'm feeling is the withdrawal from the venlafaxine. when my meds come, i will get better."
353174986690805760	but i'm happy to be clean. just really really really really really really really sucked going from 100mg desvenlafaxine / day to zero.
